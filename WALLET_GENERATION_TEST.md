The wallet generation system now includes enhanced tools for testing the effectiveness of wallet creation, deletion, and management.

## 🚀 Testing the System

### Step 1: Access Wallet Management
1. Navigate to `/admin/wallet-management` in your browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12) to see console logs

### Step 2: Available Actions

- **What it does**:
  - Removes all generated wallet addresses
  - Deletes all private keys and seed phrases
  - Clears all archived wallets
  - Resets to production wallets using environment variables
- **Console Output**: Shows detailed deletion progress
- **Confirmation**: Strong warning dialog with detailed explanation

#### 🟢 **"Generate All" Button**
- **Purpose**: Generate fresh wallets for all supported networks at once
- **What it creates**:
  - Bitcoin Main Wallet
  - Ethereum Main Wallet
  - XRP Main Wallet
  - Solana Main Wallet
  - Tron Main Wallet
  - BSC Main Wallet
- **Console Output**: Shows generation progress for each network
- **API Integration**: Uses `/api/wallets/generate` endpoint

#### 🟡 **"Generate Wallet" Button**
- **Purpose**: Create individual wallets with custom settings
- **Modal Interface**: Select network, enter label, customize options
- **Supported Networks**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Tron, BSC

### Step 3: Testing Workflow

```bash
# Recommended test sequence:

1. 🔍 Check Current State
   - View existing wallets in the dashboard
   - Note addresses and counts

2. 🗑️ Clear Everything
   - Click "Reset Wallets"
   - Confirm deletion
   - Observe console logs showing what was cleared

3. 📊 Verify Clean State
   - Check that only production wallets remain
   - Verify addresses match environment variables

4. ⚡ Generate All Networks
   - Click "Generate All"
   - Watch console logs for each network generation
   - Wait for automatic reload

5. ✅ Verify Generation
   - Check new wallets appear in dashboard
   - Verify each network has a unique address
   - Test individual wallet details
```

### Step 4: What to Observe

#### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Console shows detailed generation progress
- New unique addresses for each network
- Proper network icons and labels
- Working private key/seed phrase display
- Successful API responses (200 status)

#### ❌ **Potential Issues**
- 404 errors (API endpoint problems)
- Duplicate addresses (generation not working)
- Missing wallet data (storage issues)
- Console errors (JavaScript problems)
